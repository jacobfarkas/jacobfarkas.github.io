<p>LREI -- Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School -- is looking for a support person who loves to help people, has good interpersonal skills, and an interest in schools and educational technology.
  <p>You should know how to Google a problem that you need guidance in approaching. You should be able to say things like “I don’t know, but I’ll find out” and unafraid to ask “Hey, can you explain how that system works again?”
  <p>You should be comfortable with online collaboration tools that help teams communicate and organize their tasks. We hope you are flexible, self-starting, delighted by learning new things, a willingness to ask questions, a positive attitude, and a helpful nature.
  <p>Ideally, we want someone motivated to learn and assume systems administration responsibilities. We offer professional development opportunities and mentorship for that endeavor.</p>
